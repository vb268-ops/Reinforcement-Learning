# Reinforcement-Learning

This repository has work done on Reinforcement Learning (RL) in different areas of application:

1. Q-Network: A Q-Network based on a Logistic Regression model is created to obtain a policy for a bear to fetch the fish in the map. It is observed that the choice of loss function in this task is critical to getting to a desirable policy.
